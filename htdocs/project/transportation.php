      <h1>Transportation Guide</h1>
     
      <article>Istanbul stretches over 5,000 km ² therefore moving is not always easy because on one hand it is one of the most congested cities in the world and secondly its topography makes the development of transport complex (Istanbul, like Rome was built on seven hills ). There is currently a major project in the city to develop public transport in Istanbul. This project is mainly in the development of the Istanbul metro and connecting the two continents. The first step of this project was inaugurated on October 29 of 2013, and allowed the connection between the Asian and European side via a rail tunnel under the Bosphorus.</article>

      <h3> Modern Tramway</h3>
     
      <article>In Europe there are two lines in service , the T1 line from Kabataş allows easy access to Sultanahmet and the T4 line that goes north – west of the city . It runs from 6am to 11pm. The tram in Istanbul is very clean and air conditioned.

The T1 line will allow you to reach the main attractions of the city. We recommend that you use it as is really cheap and fast and definitely easiest way to get to the old town.

<h4>Karaköy-Tünel (T)</h4>

It allows you to go quickly down the Istiklal Street and you will avoid climbing the slopes to get in neighborhoods like Galata. Once in Tünel you can use the historical tram (NT) to go to Taksim Square . It runs from 7am to 9pm .

<h4>Taksim-Kabataş (F1)</h4>

It allows you to go from Taksim Square to Kabatas . From here you can take the tram (T1) to get to the old town and the boat to the Princes islands in Kadikoy . To go to the old town another option is to take the M2 metro directly to the Golden Horn (Haliç stop) from Taksim.</article>

      <h3> The Subway</h3>
     
      <article>

It is open from 6:15 to 0:00 , there are currently two lines on the European side . Unfortunately these two lines are not connected yet . There is also a line on the Asian shore but it is not of great interest to you because it is not yet connected to Sabiha Gokcen Airport .
<br><br>
Atatürk airport – Aksaray (M1)

If your hotel is located in Sultanahmet this line will get you from Ataturk Airport to Aksaray then you take the tram (T1).
<br><br>
Yenikapi-Hacıosman (M2)
It is the longuest  line of the Istanbul metro. This is the one you need the most during your stay. Since the beginning of the year it has been lengthened, it is now possible to visit the old city from Taksim Square and more. This is especially useful for business men residing in the district of Levent, or for travelers who have chosen to reside in more Turkish and less touristy areas like Nisantasi. Taksim Square is now only 2 stop Eminönü district where the spice market is located.

The main stops of the M2 are :
<br><br>
Yenikapi  — his station is intended to be the hub of transport in Istanbul. You can already use the Marmaray from Yenikapi (the metro passing under the Bosphorus ) to reach Uskudar on the Asian side .
<br><br>
Haliç — This is the most useful new station for tourists wishing to reach the old town or for those wishing to go from the old town to other areas that seem less accessible. You will be near the Spice Bazaar and Eminonu tram station (T1).
<br><br>
Şişhane — Just down the street Istiklal you will join the Tünel funicular located right next to the station  and the Galata district .
<br><br>
Taksim — Located in Taksim Square, the station can be reached quickly by foot from the districts such as Cihangir, Beyoglu or Cukurcuma . You can also use the funicular (F1) to get to Kabataş where you’ll take the ferry for Asia and the Princes Islands and the tram (T1) to get to the old town.
<br><br>
Osmanbey — Located just minutes from the upscale Nisantasi district . Very nice area with many bars and restaurants as well as luxury shops and many Turkish designers.
<br><br>
Levent — This is the business district of Istanbul. There is also close to the metro two major shopping malls : Kanyon and Metrocity
<br><br>
İTÜ Ayazağa — Located near the chic shopping gallery İstinye Park (you need a little walk or take a taxi or a minibus) . This gallery is a paradise for all lovers of fashion and luxury , you will find all the most luxurious brands .</article>

      <h3>Metrobus</h3>
     
      <article>


These are buses that run on dedicated lanes to avoid congestion. These buses generally run around the outskirts of the city mostly and therefore are not of great interest to tourists. See map :

      <h3>Boats</h3>
     
      <article>

They allow you to move from Europe to Asia, and save a lot of time because the bridges over the Bosphorus are constantly congested . Once on the ferry you will truly understand the huge size of the city, it is also a good way to see the city from the water .

The main piers on the European side are Eminonu, Besiktas and Kabatas and on the Asian side Uskudar and Kadikoy .

From Kabataş and Kadikoy and you can also reach the Princes islands for 5TL .

see our article: A day at the Princes Islands

For more information on schedules visit: http://www.sehirhatlari.com.tr/

If you want to take a ride on the Bosphorus (see our article ideas for a day in Istanbul – The Bosphorus (2 days) ) – we advise you to take the boat from Besiktas or Ortakoy rather than departing from Eminonu which is always full and less comfortable .
